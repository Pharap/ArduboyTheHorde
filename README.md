# About
The Horde is a top down zombie survival game. All you youngins' out there might associate this game with [Dead Ops Arcade](https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Dead_Ops_Arcade) from the first Call of Duty Black Ops. You play as a single character on the screen represented by a hollow circle. You can move in any direction. When you fire your weapon, the shot travels in the same direction as the current direction you are facing your character.  
Zombies are presented by a semi-solid circle. They spawn off screen and will immediately start chasing you. The number of zomies spawned is equivalent to the current wave. Zombies can spawn with variable speeds but never with speed greater than your character. If any part of a zombie touches your character, you die.  
Zombies drop powerups and it would behoove you to pick up those powerups. More on this later.

# Powerups
When you kill a zombie, there is a 10% chance the zombie will drop a powerup. The powerup can be any weapon greater than or equal to your current weapon, or an aid powerup.
Dropped powerups are represented by a stationary hollow circle (like your character). They can be picked up by running into them.
## Weapons
The following weapons can be obtained through powerups.
### Pistol
- semi-automatic
- One bullet kills one zombie
- This is the weapon you start with.
